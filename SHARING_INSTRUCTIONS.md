# Sales Dashboard - Sharing Instructions

## How to Share the Dashboard

### Option 1: Direct File Sharing (Recommended)
1. **Zip the entire "Sales Dashboard" folder**
2. **Send the zip file** to the person you want to share with
3. **They extract it** and open `index.html` directly in their browser

### Option 2: Cloud Storage
1. **Upload the "Sales Dashboard" folder** to:
   - Google Drive
   - OneDrive  
   - Dropbox
2. **Share the folder** with the person
3. **They download it** and open `index.html`

### Option 3: GitHub Repository
1. **Share the repository URL:** https://github.com/BrittBloom/Sales-Dashboard
2. **They can download the zip** by clicking "Code" â†’ "Download ZIP"
3. **Extract and open `index.html`**

## Important Notes
- The dashboard works best when opened directly from the `index.html` file
- No server setup is required
- Works on any device with a web browser
- All data is loaded from Google Sheets (requires internet connection)

## Troubleshooting
- If the dashboard shows "No Data", check the Google Sheets connection
- Make sure all files are in the same folder
- Open `index.html` directly in the browser (not through a server)
